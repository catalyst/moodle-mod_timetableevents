# Timetable events

This plugin displays events on the course page, in the section corresponding to the week where they occur.

An instance of the module should be added to each section where events should be displayed, and the
module's settings configured to define the date range that each section should display events for.

Events can be imported via a web service. They will also appear in the calendar interface, alongside
normal events.
